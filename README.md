# COVID 19 Data Analysis Project

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data using SQL. It includes several queries to analyze the impact of COVID-19 across different countries (including my country of residence: Ghana) and continents.

## Project Structure and Key Features

### 1. Overview of COVID-19 Data
* **Death Data**: Basic selection and ordering of COVID-19 death data.
* **Vaccination Data**: Basic selection and ordering of vaccination data.

### 2. Key Metrics and Comparisons
* **Total Cases vs. Total Deaths in Ghana**: Analysis of the relationship between total cases and total deaths.
* **Total Cases vs. Population in Ghana**: Percentage of the population infected with COVID-19.
* **Highest Infection Rates by Country Globally**: Identifying countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population.
* **Highest Death Counts by Country Globally**: Determining countries with the highest death counts.
* **Highest Death Counts by Continent**: Analyzing death counts across different continents.
* **Global Summary Numbers**: Daily tracking of new cases, total deaths, and death percentages globally.

### 3. Vaccination Analysis
* **Total Population vs. Total Vaccinations Globally**: Relationship between population size and vaccination numbers.
* **Rolling Vaccination Rates (CTE)**: Using Common Table Expressions (CTE) to calculate and analyze rolling vaccination rates.
* **Intermediate Calculations (Temp Table)**: Utilizing temporary tables for detailed intermediate calculations.

### 4. Data Visualization Preparation
* **Creating a View**: Storing calculated data for efficient future visualizations.

## Key Features

* **Daily Trends**: Track daily new cases, total deaths, and death percentages across continents and specific locations (e.g., Ghana).
* **Infection Rates**: Analyze the relationship between total cases and population to identify regions with high infection prevalence.
* **Death Rates**: Compare COVID-19 deaths to population size to pinpoint areas with disproportionately high death tolls.
* **Global Statistics**: Gain a holistic view of global COVID-19 numbers, including daily new cases, total deaths, and death percentages.
* **Vaccination Analysis**: Explore the relationship between total population, new vaccinations, and rolling vaccination rates to assess immunization progress.
* **Clear Explanations**: Each query is accompanied by comments explaining its purpose and the calculations involved.

## Distinctive Aspects

* **Focus on Insights**: This project goes beyond basic data aggregation by calculating percentages, ratios, and rolling totals, providing deeper understanding of the pandemic's impact.
* **Comparative Analysis**: Queries compare data points (e.g., deaths vs. population) to identify areas needing targeted interventions.
* **Flexibility**: Easily adapt the queries to your specific data structure and analysis needs.

## Instructions

1. Ensure you have access to a SQL database server that supports the provided queries.
2. Replace `PortfolioProject` with the actual schema name in your database if it differs.
3. Feel free to modify or extend the queries based on your specific research interests.

## Beyond the Code

The included queries form a solid foundation for further exploration. Consider these additional avenues:

* **Visualization**: Create charts and graphs to visually represent trends and patterns in the data.
* **Prediction Models**: Develop statistical models to forecast future caseloads and death rates.
* **Spatial Analysis**: Utilize location data (if available) to map high-risk areas and assess geographical spread.

## Collaboration

This repository welcomes your contributions! Feel free to fork, modify, and share your insights to enhance this collaborative resource.

## Conclusion

This refined response elevates the project by emphasizing insightful analysis, comparative approaches, flexibility, and directions for further exploration. It stands out from generic projects by focusing on practical applications and fostering collaboration. By combining the best aspects of both responses and addressing their potential shortcomings, this enhanced response provides a valuable resource for anyone studying the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Prerequisites

* SQL Server or any SQL-compliant database.
* Access to the PortfolioProject..CovidDeathData and PortfolioProject..CovidVaccinationsData tables.

## Insights

This project provides valuable insights into the spread and impact of COVID-19, highlighting infection and death rates, and the progress of vaccination efforts globally and locally. It uses advanced SQL techniques such as window functions, CTEs, and views to manage and analyze the data efficiently.

## Description

This repository delves into COVID-19 data from the PortfolioProject..CovidDeathData and PortfolioProject..CovidVaccinationsData tables, offering a comprehensive analysis beyond basic statistics. Explore trends, identify high-risk areas, and gain valuable insights to inform public health strategies.
